1. I am William Scott, a Student at Boys' Latin Highschool. At home, I enjoy drawing, playing video games, and watching Anime. I was inspired by anime to draw and create my own characters and story. When I get the resources and when I get older,I would want to make Manga.
2. As far as I know, there is no one in my family connected to tech.
3. I do intend on attending college at some point. I would like to Major in Visual Arts if possible.
4. In my opinion, Coding is only as hard as I make it. It is my responsibility to make sure I am caught up and to ask for help when needed.
5. I do not watch the NFL, or any sports related media.
