// 1. What does 'string concatenation' mean? Please write your response as a string and also provide a code example of two variables being concatenated and output the result in your terminal.
"string concatenation is the process of pairing strings to two or more strings with the + symbol. example below. "
a = "Nice";
b = "Job!";
c = a + " " + b;
console.log(string1+string2)

// 2. Please list and describe three rules for creating variable names. Please provide your answer as a string.
'const- used to declare variables that WILL NOT change'
'let- used to declare variables that WILL change'
'var- universal/ default variable, can be used in any context'

"1. variable names must start with a letter and not a number"
"2. they cannot contain spaces"
"3. variable names cannot be reserved words"

// 3. Define each of the following variable name formats then provide a code example of how you would write them.
// Camel case| every word after the first word is capitalized.
var username=''
var timeRemainingInqrtr= ''
// Snake case| naming convention in which each word is separated by underscores
var user_name =''
var time_Remaining_in_qrtr= ''
// Pascal case| Each word is started with a capital letter
MyGoodName = "William"


// 4. Find the missing variable for each of the following assignment operaor code snippets.
// JavaScript Version 
let a = 350

let b = a *2

console.log(b) // the output in the terminal should be 700





// 5. Use the logical operators and evaluate the following variables to get the requested result.
// which logical operator would you use to reflect that the result between the code expressions below are false. 
// Use the console.log() function to output the result in the termial, 
// then explain why you would use that particular logical operator using a string.
var x= 12

var y= 2

var z= 12/y

console.log(!(x <= 12) && z < 10)
// 12 is less than or equal to 12 - true
// 6 less than 1- true
