"A variable in Javascript is declared in the following ways: var, let, and const."

// 2.
const u = '// declares when a constant variable SHOULD NOT change. It is a constant.'

// 3.
"=== refers to equivalent value and equivalent type. == refers to data being equal to. = is an assignment operator that assigns two values together"

// 4. 
"I would want to use the comparison operator whenever I want to compare two pieces of data."
let text1 = "A";
let text2 = "B";
let result = text1 < text2;
'in this instance, text one is compared to text 2.'

// 5. 
"a logical operator could be used in order to make a logical description between two things."
" &&| logical and"
"|| | logical or"
"!  |logical not"

// 6.
var a= 2
var b= 6
var c= 3

console.log(a*b*c)  

// 7.
var x = 14
var y = x *2

console.log(y)

// 8.
"concatenation is the idea of pairing strings to other strings."
let string1 = "Nice";
let string2 = "Job!";
let string3 = string1 + " " + string2;
