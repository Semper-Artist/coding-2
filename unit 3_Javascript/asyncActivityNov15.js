// 1. A company is developing a security system that requires 2 factor authorization. 
// This means that the system needs to verify that 2 pieces of data are correct for the person to enter the building. 
// When someone approached the building they need to have the correct name and correct passcode to enter the building.
// Which operator would be used here? Please provide a code example of how you would write this and output the result using the print() function for python or the console.log() function for javascript?

"The comparison operator can be used for this situation by using '=='(same as or equal to)"
var userPassword= 12467
var dbPassword= 12467
console.log(userPassword == dbPassword)
// If this code is ran in the terminal, one can see that 
// the password is true. The person could safely enter the 
// building.


// 2. The Arithmetic operator can help to keep track of both variables
let EGCmachine = 10
let EGCmachineRecieved = 4
console.log(EGCmachine - EGCmachineRecieved)
// It will tell that they need 6 more EGC machines

"For oxygen tanks, the same operator can be used."
let oxytankneeded = 6
let oxytankoveracquired = 9
console.log(oxytankoveracquired - oxytankneeded)
// The terminal would share that they need to send back three oxytanks to keep 
// their storage at the wanted 6.

// 3. The string operator would be used when users must be able to
// capture user data and then send it to someone else.
" user data sending: abcdefg"

// 4.

"&& expresses a logical and, pairing two or more things."
