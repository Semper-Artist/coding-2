// 1. Describe the difference between var, let, and const. Your answer can be formatted as a comment or a string.

// 2. Use what you've learned about data types and variables and create three variables that when multiplied together will result in the value 4000. Research the console.log() function on w3schools to output your result in the terminal.

// 3. Describe a scenario where you would use the let variable and when you would use a const variable in a computer program. Your answer can be formatted as a comment or a string.

// 4. If there were three things you that feel could improve the class, what would those things be and why? Your answer can be formatted as a comment or a string.

"1."
// var is a universal container for data, making it well versed. 
// let varifies that information can or is allowed to change.
// const declares that data CANNOT or SHOULD NOT change. It
// is a constant.


"2."
 print('2 x 2 x 1000= 4000')

 
 
 "3."
 "You would use the let variable to show time, because time will change every second or minute."
 "Const would be used to show the current city you want to tell the weather in."

 "4."
 // I do not feel that the class should change. 
 // The class is like a college course.
 // If students do not lock in, they are more prone to fail.
