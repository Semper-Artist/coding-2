// What is a function ?
// A function a set of instructions that perform a specific task 
// or job.

// There are two variations of functions:
// Built-in functions: these are instructions that are already
// in the programming language and all you need to do is 
// pass it data.
// console.log() is an example of a built-in function
name= 'william scott'
console.log(name)

// User defined functions: these are custom instructions that are
//  written by engineers.

// How do we write a function - function syntax
// declare function
function exampleFunction() {
   console.log('the function script is connected.')
    }

// call function
exampleFunction()
let accountBalance = 100

function depositMoney(x){
    console.log('money has been added successfully.')
    console.log(accountBalance + x)
}
