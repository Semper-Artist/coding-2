// What is a function ?
// A function a set of instructions that perform a specific task 
// or job.

// There are two variations of functions:
// Built-in functions: these are instructions that are already
// in the programming language and all you need to do is 
// pass it data.
// console.log() is an example of a built-in function

// User defined functions: these are custom instructions that are
//  written by engineers.
